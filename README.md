# TensorFlow Crash Course

## Jupyter Notebooks made by me, following a TensorFlow course by Tim Ruscica (TechWithTim)

This repo is structured in just one folder, containing every notebook I've created for this course. Here I've learnt how to create different types of Neural Networks
(Sequential, Convolutional...) and apply them to real world tasks such as image recognition and computer vision. Notebooks are divided in the following topics:
 - Module 1. Introduction to TensorFlow, syntax, structure, etc.
 - Module 2. Core Learning Algorithms such as Linear Regression, K-Means, etc. Also, use of Pandas Dataframes and TF Datasets.
 - Module 3. Creating my very first NN (Sequential) and analyzing MNIST's Fashion Dataset.
